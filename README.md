Easy Easel - Drawing vector graphics with Easel.js
===

Most Canvas drawing apps export only bitmaps, which don't look good when transformed, and are heavier in file size.

This is yet another Canvas drawing app, except it exports [EaselJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS) code, a vector-based renderer for the canvas.

### Todo
* Decoding & encoding other drawing instructions, such as stroke, fill & color.
* Smoothing lines
* Animation
